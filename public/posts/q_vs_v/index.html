        <h1>What is the difference between V(s) and Q(s,a)?</h1>
        <p>State value function $V(s)$ expresses how well the agent expects to do when it acts normally. $Q(s, a)$ is a counterfactual function that expresses how well the agent expects to do if first takes some potentially alternative action before acting normally.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-precise-definition">A more precise definition</h2>
<p>Before making that more precise, let&rsquo;s add a point of clarity. Value functions (both V and Q) are always with respect to some policy $\pi$.
To indicate that they are with respect to policy $\pi$, we often write them as $V^\pi(s)$ and $Q^\pi(s)$.
In the case when we’re talking about the value functions for the optimal policy $\pi^*$, we often use the shorthand $V^*(s)$ and $Q^*(s, a)$. Sometimes in literature we leave off the $\pi$ or $*$ and just refer to $V$ and $Q$, because it’s implicit in the context. Regardless, every value function is always with respect to some policy.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let&rsquo;s give the more precise definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>$V^\pi(s)$ expresses the expected value of the (discounted) future return when following policy $\pi$ from state $s$.</li>
<li>$Q^\pi(s, a)$ expresses the expected value of the (discounted) future return when first taking action $a$ from state $s$ and then following policy $\pi$ after that first step.</li>
</ul>
<p>While $V$ tells you how good your policy is, the Q-function lets you evaluate how good it is to take alternative actions for the first time step .<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>
<p>To illustrate this difference, consider the below three-state MDP where the agent can go left or right and receives -1 reward until it reaches the terminating goal on the right. The straight blue arrows indicate the optimal policy always going to the right.</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/q_vs_v/3state.png"><figcaption>
      <h4>A Three-state MDP to illustrate the difference between Q and V</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The state value for any of the states can be easily determined by counting the number of blue arrows until the goal is reached. E.g., $V^\pi(B) = -1\ $ because it is just one step away from the goal. Similarly, the Q-value $Q^\pi(B, \mathrm{right}) = -1$, because the right action is the same action our policy selects. However, we can also evaluate the Q-value for the alternative left action. In this case, $Q^\pi(B, \mathrm{left}) = -3$, because first the agent will go left (following the off-policy orange arc) to state $A$, and then after that step it will follow the blue arcs of our policy back to state $B$ and then to final state $C$.</p>
<h2 id="why-q-is-useful">Why Q is useful</h2>
<p>The above example illustrates the difference between Q and V. However, in that example, knowing the Q-value for the bad action wasn&rsquo;t especially useful, so you may be wondering why we care about Q-values. The reason, of course, is that when the agent starts learning, it will not know the optimal policy. When the policy is suboptimal some of those counterfactual off-policy actions will have higher Q-values then the state value of the current suboptimal policy. When that is the case, knowing which actions have higher Q-values let&rsquo;s you identify how you can improve you policy.</p>
<p>To illustrate that, let&rsquo;s have a slightly more complex MDP with a suboptimal policy shown below.</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/q_vs_v/6state.png"><figcaption>
      <h4>A six-state MDP to illustrate how the Q-function can be used to improve the policy.</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this case, the policy is near optimal except at state A where it goes up to B instead of right to C. Consequently, we have $V(A) = -4\ $. However, the Q-function for counterfactual action &ldquo;right&rdquo; shows a better expected return with $Q(A, \mathrm{right}) = -2\ $. This differences indicates that we can improve our policy by setting $\pi(A) = \mathrm{right}$.</p>
<p>There are of course other ways to improve your policy without learning a Q-function, but it is a common a way to do it!</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Be careful! $Q^\pi(s, a)$ is not the same as asking what the value is if you change your policy to be $\pi(s) \triangleq a$. It&rsquo;s asking what the value would be if you took $a$ only on that first step. If the policy eventually returns you to state $s$, the value upon return is evaluated by following what actions the policy would usually select for the state. Our example will help make this clear.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
