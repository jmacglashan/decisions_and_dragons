        <h1>Why does the policy gradient include a log probability term?</h1>
        <p>Actually, it doesn&rsquo;t! What you&rsquo;re probably thinking of is the <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/williams92simple.pdf">REINFORCE</a> <em>estimate</em> of the policy gradient. How we derive the REINFORCE estimate you&rsquo;re familiar with and <em>why</em> we use it is something I found to be poorly explained in literature. Fortunately, it is not a hard concept to learn!</p>
<p>The log probability term emerges because REINFORCE uses a trick to make the policy gradient look like an expected value over the gradient, and the log probability serves as an importance sampling correction for this alternative expression. We use this trick because we&rsquo;d like to use the actions the agent takes to estimate the gradient, but the analytic gradient would require us to observe the outcomes of all actions, including the ones the agent didn&rsquo;t take.</p>
<p>That might not make much sense yet. Let&rsquo;s remedy that.</p>
<h2 id="the-policy-objective">The policy objective</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s answer the following: what is the objective function we want to maximize? From “<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1999/file/464d828b85b0bed98e80ade0a5c43b0f-Paper.pdf">Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation</a>” we have the following objective:
$$
J(\pi) = \sum_s d^\pi(s) \sum_a \pi(a | s) Q^\pi(s, a)
$$
where</p>
<ul>
<li>$d^\pi(s)$ defines the (discounted<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>) probability of being in state $s$ when following policy $\pi$,</li>
<li>$\pi(a | s)$ defines the probability of selecting action $a$ from state $s$ when following policy $\pi$,</li>
<li>$Q^\pi(s, a)$ is our usual Q-function defining the expected future (discounted) return when taking action $a$ from state $s$ and then following policy $\pi$ for all subsequent time steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>This math might feel a bit scary, but in words, the objective is the average Q-value (across all states and actions) when following the policy. Adjusting your policy to maximize this objective means the average Q-value goes up, which in turn means the averaged expected future return is higher, which is of course the objective of RL!</p>
<p>The question is <em>how</em> do we optimize this objective? If we are defining our policy with a neural net or some other differentiable function approximation, we can compute gradients of the objective with respect to the policy neural net parameters $\theta$ and use something like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to improve the policy.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-true-policy-gradient">The true policy gradient</h2>
<p>Of course that means we need to know how to compute the gradient of that objective. The main result of the policy gradient theorem is that the derivative of the objective with respect to any single parameter $\theta$  is the following:
$$
\frac{d}{d\theta} J(\pi) = \sum_s d^\pi(s) \sum_a \frac{d \pi(a | s)}{d\theta} Q^\pi(s, a)
$$</p>
<p>The neat and important property of this result is we really only need to compute the gradients of the probability that our policy will take any given action. Then we can multiply that by the Q-value. We don&rsquo;t need to compute gradients through transition functions, which usually are not known in RL problems.</p>
<p>We do of course need an estimate of our Q-values too, and we need to take the average over our states. The tempting approach is to use samples for these remaining bits. I.e., maybe we could execute our policy in our environment a bunch of times, estimate Q-values with observed returns, multiply them by the gradient of the action probabilities, and average over the visited states?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no, on its own that will not work.</p>
<h2 id="no-takesies-backsies">No takesies backsies</h2>
<p>To see the problem, let&rsquo;s ignore the state distribution part of the objective and focus on the last part:
$$
\sum_a \frac{d \pi(a | s)}{d\theta} Q^\pi(s, a)
$$
This may look like an expected value, but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s the <em>derivative</em> of an expected value. Because of that, we cannot estimate the gradient by multiplying the Q-value with the gradient of sampled action probabilities. To compute the gradient correctly for each state, we&rsquo;d have to know what the Q-value is for every action, and sum their gradients together.</p>
<p>Summing over all the actions for each state may not sound bad, but in RL, you have to live with the consequences of your action choice. You cannot undo it and then try a different action to see what would happen. And even if we could, that&rsquo;s a lot of extra environment interactions! For every state we visit, we&rsquo;d have to roll out another trajectory for every other possible action we could have taken. (Good luck if your actions are continuous!)</p>
<h2 id="reinforce-to-the-rescue">REINFORCE to the rescue</h2>
<p>Fortunately, REINFORCE provides us a way to turn our derivative of an expected value into an expected value involving the derivative of the action probability. This new expression allows us to estimate the gradient with samples. To achieve this, REINFORCE uses an approach very similar to importance sampling. If you are not familiar with importance sampling, that&rsquo;s okay, we&rsquo;re going to walk through it.</p>
<p>We begin by doing something ridiculous: inside the sum, we&rsquo;re going to multiply everything by the probability of our policy taking the action and immediately divide by it to cancel it:
$$
\sum_a \frac{d \pi(a | s)}{d\theta} Q^\pi(s, a) = \sum_a \frac{\pi(a | s)}{\pi(a | s)} \frac{d \pi(a | s)}{d\theta} Q^\pi(s, a)
$$
So far, we&rsquo;ve done nothing. All we did was add needless work by multiplying by the policy probability and dividing by it. But when you look at it this way, you may notice that this is the same as an expected value!
$$
\sum_a \frac{\pi(a | s)}{\pi(a | s)} \frac{d \pi(a | s)}{d\theta} Q^\pi(s, a) = E_{a \sim \pi(\cdot | s)} \left[ \frac{1}{\pi(a | s)}  \frac{d \pi(a | s)}{d\theta} Q^\pi(s, a) \right]
$$
Now we&rsquo;re in business: we can estimate this expectation using samples from following our policy. The sampled returns can be used to estimate Q, and the action samples follow our new expected value distribution. Our naive hope was <em>almost</em> right. All we had to do to correct for the fact that we weren&rsquo;t uniformly summing the policy gradients is divide by the probability of our policy selecting the action it took.</p>
<p>Except I promised log probabilities and as of now they haven&rsquo;t shown up.</p>
<h2 id="enter-log-probabilities">Enter log probabilities</h2>
<p>Fortunately, introducing the log probability is just one more step away. Let&rsquo;s remark on this simple calculus identity about the derivative of logs:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \log f(x)= \frac{1}{f(x)} \frac{df(x)}{dx}
$$
You will notice the right-hand-side of that appears in our REINFORCE estimate of the gradient. Therefore, we can simplify the REINFORCE expression
by substituting the derivative of the policy probability divided by policy probability with the derivative of the log policy probability.
$$
E_{a \sim \pi(\cdot | s)} \left[ \frac{1}{\pi(a | s)}  \frac{d \pi(a | s)}{d\theta} Q^\pi(s, a) \right] = E_{a \sim \pi(\cdot | s)} \left[ \frac{d\log \pi(a | s)}{d\theta} Q^\pi(s, a) \right]
$$
In addition to simplifying the expression, using the log probability is usually preferable because it tends to be more numerically
stable for floating-point math on computers. As such, we almost always use the log probability formulation.</p>
<h2 id="any-other-heroes-for-hire">Any other heroes for hire?</h2>
<p>In this answer, we showed how REINFORCE comes to our rescue and allows us to use action samples to estimate the policy gradient. But there are other ways to address this problem. In particular, a method called <em>reparameterization</em> is a strong alternative. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290">soft actor-critic</a> space of algorithms is perhaps the most well known setting where it is employed to estimate policy gradients. However, using reparameterization for policy gradients requires a different set of assumptions and trade offs relative to REINFORCE, so it&rsquo;s not always the right pick. It particular, it often requires you to learn a Q-function to optimize the policy, and the learned Q-function introduces bias.</p>

<p>When solving discounted future reward problems &ndash; the most common case in RL &ndash; the state distribution is a little funny. In this case, it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> just the probability (density) of being in a state. It&rsquo;s the <em>discounted</em> probability. Without going into too much detail, this discounts the probability by how long it takes to reach a state and averages over all the different lengths of time it could take. One way to think about discounted probability is by noting an equivalence between solving a discounted MDP and solving a modified undiscounted MDP where there is a probability of $1 - \gamma$ of transitioning to an absorbing state at any time. In practice, algorithms often ignore this fact, but to be mathematically precise, the policy gradient for discounted MDPs use discounted state probability distributions. A more complete discussion of this topic is left for another time.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
