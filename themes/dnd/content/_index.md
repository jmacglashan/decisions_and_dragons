This site gathers my responses to reinforcement learning questions from various social media platforms and interactions.

Each answer begins with a concise explanation, accessible to those with relevant background knowledge. Of course, if you're here, you may not have _all_ of the relevant background knowledge. This site is written for those of you who do not. Following the concise explanation, I derive the answer from first principles.

Below you will find a list of the most recently published Q&As and a preview of the answers. You can find the complete list in the [posts section](/posts/). You can learn more about
me and why I created this site in the [about section](/about/).
